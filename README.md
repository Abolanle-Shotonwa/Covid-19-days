This is the analysis of covid-19 jobs done at hand 
As part of my learning journey as a prospective Data Analyst at Vephla University, I recently analyzed a comprehensive dataset for Eterna & Sons Storage Limited, covering key business metrics for the year 2023. This analysis included insights on total goods supplied across regions, identification of top-selling and most-supplied items, and warehouse supply figures.

Observations
Top Suppliers: Republic National and The Country Vintner experienced peak sales at year-end, largely attributed to increased demand during Christmas celebrations.
Warehouse Supplies: In July, warehouse supplies reached 41,894.42, marking a significant inventory flow.
Best-Selling Items: Items such as Tenth Ward Dist Co Caraway and Rye - 750ml Linganore Black Raven saw high demand, especially in the final months of the year.
Most Supplied Product: Wine emerged as the best-supplied product across various locations.
Recommendations
Marketing Efforts for Lesser-Selling Suppliers: Suppliers like Anheuser Busch Inc. and Prestige Beverage Group of MD LLC are advised to increase marketing efforts during the holiday season to boost visibility and sales.
Promotion Strategy for Warehouses: To elevate the September supply figures, targeted promotions could be introduced, aiming to surpass the current level of 7,416.57.
Client Acquisition for Wine in December: Given the peak in wine sales in January, particularly linked to New Yearâ€™s celebrations, suppliers should use December as a strategic period to engage new customers, setting the stage for an increase in sales at the beginning of the year.
These insights and recommendations will help refine supply chain and sales strategies, ensuring higher performance and customer satisfaction throughout the year.
